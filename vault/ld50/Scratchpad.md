 "Hi, grandchild, how are you today? There's so much I've been planning to discuss with you, like you know what happened at the pond today. I was feeding the birds and an old woman walked by. She had such a kind face, a nice smile and such pretty blond hair. You know me and old ladies. I do try to be nice to everyone I meet." - hittaus

My neighbour, you know Rob? He has those petunias in the front yard? Anyway, he painted his mailbox sky gray, which just infuriates me! I'm going to report him because he knows, HE KNOWS, that we have to paint our letterboxes brushed metal gray! But he just does whatever he wants, and I'm not going to let him get away with it this time - Daverinoe

You know how old ladies tell everything to each other, and I mean everything. Today Beth trusted me to tell the whole story. Her previous husband was helpless romantic and would write poetry to her. One day, when he was on a business trip in Arizona, he sent a bouquet of flowers to her, as well as a letter that read: "You are the love of my life. I cannot live without" - hittaus

"The worst timeline. I'm towards the very end of my life but as it's 4 am here I need to let you know that I just got the most incredible text from a friend of mine who has always been a really close. My pain was momentarily eased. I'm just now realizing that the worst timeline is" - hittaus

"These are my outlet, these beauties are my most stunning flowers. If only I would waste any time in gardening! Instead I am obsessed with taking random pictures of birds, their feathers, their nests, their songs. I love them all. All these pictures I have taken over the last year are of wild birds. But wildlife photos do not bring in any pounds. I'm not able to support these little guys. So my husband has agreed to take them off my hands. I think he will make the perfect hunter." - hittaus

"I've been trying new fertilisers for my roses, but only one thing seems to work. Bana peels, coffee grounds, none of that does anything, but you know what does? Well, you remember how I was complaining about the neighbours dog, the one that wouldn't stop digging in my flowers? Let's just say that it's giving back now, making it up to my flowers. The best fertiliser, right?" - Daverino

"Remember that time when coffee beans made a perfect heart shape? Or when the chicken was carrying the dead body of a cat? Remember when we had a regular way to raise children. The books. Remember when there was a one - stop supermarket next to the graveyard where you could buy all the fertilizers for flowers. I wonder how much fertilizers coffee needs. Mountains cant be that fertile. Even though they stand tall like young women with no fear in their eyes." - hittaus

"Oh, you did what? What a bad accident! You know, back in the day, accidents had real consequences. My husband and I, well, we had an accident, and if it wasn't for that, you wouldn't even be here! Consequences, they don't necessarily need to be bad, what do you think?" - Daverinoe

old woman can be straight, or rude, and that's wisdom, that's common sense, that's why you don't let the wife be all over the husband at the dining table. I know you don't like to discuss these matters but to be frank, I don't care. You're too timid anyways. Not trying to ruin your day but we all know, some people in bad relationships for too long become irrationally paranoid. Like, do I have the key to unlock the bathroom and take a leak whenever I want? Do I have the key to open the cabinet.. - hittaus

 I remember when you used to go to the store with two shillings and a sixpence and you'd come back with groceries for the week! And the service was friendly, smiles everywhere, and they always had time for a chat. But you don't get service like that these days, do you?- Daverino
 
 "I check the obituaries every day, you know. Names and faces I haven't seen in years keep appearing in them. What was the point of it all? Sure, I lead a nice life, but what did I accomplish? Is this all there really was to have, to experience?" - Daverinoe
